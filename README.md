# ANN_for_breast_cancer_classification

This is a classic project on Deep Learning to build a predictive system for the identification of Breast Cancer. I have used Artificical Neural Netwroks to create a model 
that can make a predication with 96% accuracy on the training dataset and with a 93% accuracy on the test dataset. This prject is an example that Deep Neural Networks can also deliver great efficiency for binary classification problems as well.
